# Alec Knutson

Welcome to my website! Here I host my current works and projects. There may be object oriented code, statistical software anaylsis using programs like R and Stata, and some Research Projects.

### About me
Currently, I am enrolled at the University of Texas at Dallas in the MS Economics Program.  I will be graduating in December of 2021 with my Master's along with a certificate in Economic and Demographic Data.  Previosuly, in the spring of 2020, I graduated from UTD with a BS in Mathematics with a specalization in Statistics and an Economics minor.  Beyond just school, I enjoy playing guitar and strategizing over board games.

I am currently seeking out a full time position as a Data Scientist in Janaury.

### Effects of Active Service on Veterna's Wages - May 2021
This project resulted in a final paper written and in LaTex, which was my first experience using the program as my main text editor.  The below you will find the abstract of the [full paper](Project Paper (MultiVar Reg Analysis Spring 2021).pdf), which is an investigation into the effects of active service of veteran's wages when returning to the civilian workforce.  The analysis was primarily done in Stata16 and the data was sourced from ICPSR.

"Studies on veterans in the civilian market is not a new subject. However, many advances have been made in both politics and society in order to aid in veterans’ reintroduction into society. This paper reviews previous literature in order to identify pitfalls in the analysis of veterans’ and their wages. Being aware of these pitfalls, a strategy is formulated and then executed in order to analyze the effect that active military service has on service member’s financial well-being once they are reintegrated back into society."


### The Design and Implmentation of a Relational Database - April 2021
Below you will find a small excerpt from my [final paper](alecknutson_finalproject (Info Managmenet Spring 2021).pdf) as well as a scheme for a database that I designed, implemented, and ingested data to in Postgres.

"I have chosen to create a University database for my final project.  It consists of eleven relations in order to track University required information.  In general, this information includes students, classes, staff, and capital that the university owns.  In order to keep everything organized, I used a relational database model when designing the schema, shown below.  This paper is broken up into four parts.  First, I will discuss the database design.  Second, I will briefly mention the data that is housed in each relation.  Next, I will discuss the front-end design that I was able to implement.  Lastly, we will discuss how the limitations of this database and how this project could be improved upon in the future."
