Welcome to my website! Here I host my current works and projects. There may be object oriented code, statistical software anaylsis using programs like R and Stata, and some Research Projects.

### About me
Currently, I am enrolled at the University of Texas at Dallas in the MS Economics Program.  In the spring of 2020, I graduated from UTD with a BS in Mathematics with a specalization in Statistics and an Economics minor.  Beyond just school, I enjoy playing guitar and strategizing over board games.
